# TODO App Integration Test Results

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Backend Integration ✅
- [x] User settings with `todos_per_page` field in database and API
- [x] JWT auth with HTTP-only cookies
- [x] Board permissions and user management
- [x] Todo CRUD operations with pagination support
- [x] All endpoints properly implemented
- [x] **NEW**: Board sharing and permissions system

### Frontend Integration ✅
- [x] **User Settings Integration**: All user settings (todos per page, refresh interval, uppercase descriptions) are now unified in a single settings page with server synchronization
- [x] **Pagination**: `useTodos` hook now uses `settings.todos_per_page` instead of Redux state
- [x] **UI Updates**: `ToDoList` component uses user settings for items per page
- [x] **Text Display**: `ToDoItem` component uses user settings for uppercase descriptions
- [x] **Auto-refresh**: `useTodos` hook uses user settings for refresh interval
- [x] **Query Invalidation**: Settings updates properly invalidate todo queries to refresh UI
- [x] **Page Reset**: Changing todos per page resets to page 1 to avoid empty pages
- [x] **NEW**: Board sharing and permissions management in settings page

### Redux State Cleanup ✅
- [x] Removed unused `itemsPerPage` from Redux pagination state
- [x] Removed unused `config` object and related actions from Redux
- [x] Only kept essential UI state in Redux (current page, filter, search, etc.)
- [x] All user preferences now managed server-side

### 🆕 NEW: Board Sharing & Permissions System ✅

#### Features Added:
1. **Board Sharing Interface**: In settings page, users can share boards with others
2. **Permission Levels**:
   - 👑 **Owner**: Full control, can share and manage permissions
   - ✏️ **Editor**: Can view and edit todos
   - 👀 **Viewer**: Can only view todos

3. **Functionality**:
   - Share boards by email with specific permission levels
   - Update user permissions (Owner can change Editor ↔ Viewer)
   - Remove user access from boards
   - View all users with access to each board
   - Permission-based UI (only Owners can manage permissions)

#### Technical Implementation:
- **New Types**: `BoardPermission`, `ShareBoardData`, `BoardWithPermissions`
- **New Service**: `permissionsService.ts` for API calls
- **New Hooks**: `usePermissions.ts` with mutations for sharing/updating/removing
- **New Component**: `BoardSharing.tsx` for the UI interface
- **Backend Integration**: Uses existing permission endpoints from backend

#### API Endpoints Used:
- `GET /boards/:boardId/permissions` - Get board permissions
- `POST /boards/:boardId/share` - Share board with user
- `PUT /boards/:boardId/permissions/:userId` - Update permissions
- `DELETE /boards/:boardId/permissions/:userId` - Remove access
- `GET /boards` - Get accessible boards (own + shared)

### Key Features Tested ✅
1. **Unified Settings Page**: All user settings in one place with single "Save" button
2. **Server Synchronization**: Settings persist across sessions and devices
3. **Real-time Updates**: UI immediately reflects new settings without page refresh
4. **Pagination Consistency**: Todo list respects user's todos_per_page preference
5. **Text Formatting**: Descriptions show in uppercase when user setting enabled
6. **Auto-refresh**: Background refresh uses user's preferred interval
7. **🆕 Board Sharing**: Users can share boards and manage permissions seamlessly

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

1. User logs in → Settings loaded from server
2. User changes todos per page from 10 to 20 → Page resets to 1, new data loads
3. User enables uppercase descriptions → All task text immediately shows in uppercase
4. User changes refresh interval → Background queries use new timing
5. **🆕 User shares board** → Other user gets access with specified permissions
6. **🆕 User manages permissions** → Can upgrade/downgrade or remove user access
7. User logs out and back in → All settings and board access persist

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication and settings state
- **React Query**: Handles API calls with proper caching and invalidation
- **Redux**: Minimal UI state (pagination, filters, modals)
- **User Settings**: Server-synced via dedicated API endpoints
- **🆕 Permissions**: Dedicated service and hooks for board sharing

### Backend Architecture
- **Express + TypeScript**: RESTful API with proper error handling
- **SQLite**: Database with user settings and board permissions tables
- **JWT + Cookies**: Secure authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- **Argon2**: Password hashing for security
- **🆕 Permission Middleware**: Role-based access control for boards

## ✅ All Requirements Met

✅ Full-stack TODO app with user authentication
✅ Board permissions and sharing capabilities  
✅ Robust backend with proper validation and security
✅ Modern React frontend with state management
✅ Unified settings page with server synchronization
✅ Paginated and filterable todos respecting user preferences
✅ Real-time UI updates when settings change
✅ Comprehensive error handling and loading states
✅ **🆕 Board sharing with granular permission management**
✅ **🆕 Multi-user collaboration with role-based access**

The TODO app is now feature-complete with all user settings properly integrated between frontend and backend, plus a comprehensive board sharing and permissions system that allows for secure multi-user collaboration!
